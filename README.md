# Propaganda-Detection-Using-Classical-ML-BERT
This project focuses on detecting propaganda in textual data using both classical machine learning techniques and transformer-based deep learning models. It compares the effectiveness of traditional algorithms like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression with state-of-the-art models like BERT.
